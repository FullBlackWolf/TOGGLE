𝑩𝒊𝒐𝒍𝒐𝒈𝒚 𝑪𝒉𝒂𝒍𝒍𝒆𝒏𝒈𝒆𝒔:    
Terminally differentiated cells undergo programmed cell death through distinct molecular pathways, including ferroptosis, apoptosis, and pyroptosis. However, identifying specific types remains challenging due to the complexity of signaling pathways, marker genes, and the limitations of current tools.   

𝑨𝒍𝒈𝒐𝒓𝒊𝒕𝒉𝒎 𝑪𝒉𝒂𝒍𝒍𝒆𝒏𝒈𝒆𝒔:
•	Endpoint loss (e.g., missing terminal samples like dead neurons in stroke).  
•	Time loss (difficulty in sampling at multiple intervals).  
•	Sample imbalance (uneven representation of cell stages), and the absence of clear fate boundaries (gradual transitions in processes like ferroptosis).   
•	Lack of Boundaries: cell soft and same type and subtype lack type boundaries, fate prediction of neurons lacks clear boundaries between cell states  

𝑰𝒏𝒏𝒐𝒗𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏 𝒐𝒇 𝑴𝒆𝒕𝒉𝒐𝒅𝒔:
1.	Based on the ability to perform mature cell subtype/type classification and lineage tracing prediction, we extended functionality to enable classification within the same subtype/type of cells based on their specific functional states.  
2.	While existing techniques can only conduct subtype classification and lineage tracing, we enhanced the resolution of these principles to enable programmed fate differentiation, distinguishing different stages of cell fate.  
3.	We demonstrated the potential to detect RNA pathway alterations in the e-cigarette dataset and the ability to classify functional cell interactions in the rat myocardial infarction (MI) model dataset.  

𝑻𝒆𝒓𝒎𝒊𝒏𝒐𝒍𝒐𝒈𝒚 𝑬𝒙𝒑𝒍𝒂𝒏𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏:  
•	Subtype Classification: A method of categorizing cell types. Specific mature cells can differentiate into different subtypes under various conditions. For instance, CD4⁺ T cells can transition into Th1 cells, Th2 cells, Treg cells, or Tfh cells. These all belong to the broader category of T cells but represent distinct subcategories. For clarity, we define that if a cell type does not generate other subtypes, it is considered to have only one subtype.  
•	Lineage Tracing: A functional classification method for cells. It predicts the types of cells that a progenitor cell with differentiation potential will develop into. For example, hematopoietic cells may differentiate into monocytes or neutrophils.  
•	Programmed Fate Differentiation: A classification of cell fate stages. Within the same cell subtype or type, specific programmed events are initiated for a particular purpose, such as healthy cells undergoing apoptosis or ferroptosis. This is a new topic we trying to talk for single cell.
Discover of Biology:  
•	We mapped the trajectory of neuronal programmed cell death and identified neuron populations primarily undergoing ferroptosis.  
•	Key ferroptosis-driving genes, including Ctsb, Mtdh, Ndrg1, Smad7, and others, were highlighted as potential therapeutic targets. By characterizing these pathways, we provide new insights into the regulation of ferroptosis, which is essential for rescuing neurons and mitigating damage in affected brain areas.
